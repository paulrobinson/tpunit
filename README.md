tpunit
======

A simple runner for measuring throughput.

Key features:

* Multi-threded
* Allows for a warmup period (not part of results)
* Keeps threads busy for full duration of test (prevents tail of in TP towards end of test)
* Includes a command-line friendly bootstrap class (org.jboss.narayana.performance.tpunit.Bootstrap)

Getting started
===============
Take a look at the unit tests and Bootstrap.java.
